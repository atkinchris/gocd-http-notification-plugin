# Notification plugin skeleton

This is merely a skeleton plugin that plugin developers can fork to get quickly
started with writing notification plugins for GoCD.

## Getting started

* Edit the file `build.gradle`
* Edit the `GetPluginConfigurationExecutor.java` class to add any configuration fields that should be shown in the view.
* Edit the `plugin-settings.template.html` file which contains the view for the plugin settings page of your plugin.
* Edit the `PluginSettings.java` file which contains the model for your settings.
* Implement the `StageStatusRequestExecutor.java` class to get a basic notification plugin working.

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`
